# FirstCompose_Ananya

## Task 1 – Project Setup & Run Walkthrough

This project was created to confirm that my Android Studio environment is properly set up and ready for Jetpack Compose development.

The goal of this task was to create a new Compose project, run it on an emulator, and document the entire setup process.

---

## Project Information

- Template Used: Empty Compose Activity  
- Language: Kotlin  
- UI Framework: Jetpack Compose  
- IDE: Android Studio  
- Emulator: Pixel 5  
- API Level: 34 (Android 14 – UpsideDownCake)

---

## What I Did

- Opened Android Studio and created a new project using the Empty Compose Activity template.
- Named the project `FirstCompose_Ananya`.
- Kept the default settings for Kotlin and package name.
- Waited for Gradle to sync and install necessary SDK components.
- Created a Pixel 5 emulator with API 34.
- Ran the application successfully.
- Verified that the default Compose screen was displayed on the emulator.

---

## What I Learned

- The first Gradle build takes time because dependencies are downloaded.
- Jetpack Compose does not use XML layouts; UI is written directly in Kotlin.
- The `setContent {}` block defines what appears on the screen.
- `@Composable` functions are used to build UI components.

---

## Final Result

The app launched successfully on the emulator without errors.  
This confirms that my development environment is correctly configured and ready for further Jetpack Compose tasks.
